## FAQ

**What is a hackathon?**  
A hackathon is an event where participants can learn, build & share their creations over the course of the day in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer.
 
**Is there any finacial support available?**  
Yes. We have a small budget to help attendees with travel and over-night accommodation costs. Please email robert.smith@sheffield.ac.uk.

**Is the event open to everyone?**    
Yes, open to all. Must be over 18.
​
**I'm not a great programmer, can I still attend?**  
Please apply to attend. The most important thing is enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. We are interested in people who have expertise in cost-effectiveness and/or health economics but are not programmers, and the other way around.

**Is there a maximum number of attendees?**    
Yes. Places are limited. Please apply via the link and we will let you know if you have been offered a place after registration closes.

**What problems will we work on?**    
Before the start of the event we will hold an open discussion (on GitHub) about what particular problems and learning outcomes are most appropriate for the session.Then at the event itself, the projects will be outlined and participants will be able to pick and choose which projects to be involved in.

**Will there be food?**
Yes, all day we'll make sure to keep people watered and caffeinated! We will be providing lunch. Indicate when you apply about your particular dietary requirements.

**I have more questions**
Please send an email to robert.smith@sheffield.ac.uk with any further questions.
